> A personal sandbox by a student to practice C programming daily.

## 🔍 About

This repository is dedicated to daily hands‑on practice of C programming exercises.  
It’s purely for learning—no production code, just a place to experiment and build confidence with:

- C syntax and the standard library  
- Memory management (`malloc`/`free`, pointers)  
- Structs, linked lists, dynamic arrays, and other data structures  
- Writing and running simple test cases
